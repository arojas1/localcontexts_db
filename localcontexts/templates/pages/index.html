                            Eighteen TK Labels have been developed though direct community partnership and collaboration. 
                            Each TK Label can be adapted and customized to reflect ongoing relationships and authority including proper use, guidelines for action, or responsible stewardship and re-use.

                            The BC Labels are digital markers that define community expectations and consent about appropriate use of collections and data. 
                            They connect data to people and environments over time. The BC Labels provide a practical application of Indigenous data governance principles to issues of access and benefit-sharing for genetic resources.

                For researchers, Local Contexts provides specific Notices that support the recognition of Indigenous interests and function as place-holders on collections, data, or in a sample field until a TK or a BC Label is added by the community to replace it.
